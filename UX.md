# UX rules

- Best font size is `16px`: minimal readable font size is `15px` (a11y), but it is odd number. Better have even sizes (centering and etc).

- Inline components (links, lables, ...) should not have `font-size`.

- Interactive components (inputs, buttons, ...) should have `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus` and `:disabled` styles.

- Interactive components should have outline on `:focus`.

- Interactive components should have `cursor: pointer` and `cursor: default` on `:disabled`.
